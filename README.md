# **Neural Network for MNIST Classification**

## **Overview**
This project demonstrates the implementation of a basic **neural network** to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It introduces key concepts in deep learning, including:
- Neural network architecture (input, hidden, and output layers).
- Loss functions and activation functions.
- Training and evaluating a model using PyTorch.

## **Project Details**
- **Framework**: PyTorch
- **Dataset**: MNIST (handwritten digits)
  - 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
  - Each image is grayscale with dimensions 28x28.
- **Architecture**:
  - **Input Layer**: 784 neurons (flattened 28x28 image).
  - **Hidden Layers**:
    - Layer 1: 128 neurons with ReLU activation.
    - Layer 2: 64 neurons with ReLU activation.
  - **Output Layer**: 10 neurons with Softmax activation.

## **Code and Notebook**
## **Code and Notebook**
The implementation of the neural network is available in the Jupyter Notebook file:  
[Neural_Networks.ipynb](./Neural_Networks.ipynb).

You can also open the notebook in Google Colab for interactive execution:  
[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Nites-24/Neural_Networks/blob/main/Neural_Networks.ipynb)

## **Results**
The notebook contains visualizations, including:
- **Loss Plot**: Displays the reduction in loss over training epochs.
- **Test Predictions**: Visualizes sample predictions from the test set.

These visualizations can be dynamically generated by running the notebook.
