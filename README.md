# Neural_Networks
Basic neural network implementation for MNIST classification
Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a basic neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It serves as an introduction to neural networks and covers key concepts like forward propagation, loss functions, and model evaluation.

Key Learning Objectives
Understand the structure of a neural network (input, hidden, and output layers).
Learn the purpose of activation functions like ReLU.
Implement training loops using PyTorch to optimize model performance.
Visualize loss trends and test predictions.
Project Details
Framework: PyTorch
Dataset: MNIST (handwritten digits dataset)
60,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples.
Each image is 28x28 pixels and grayscale.
Architecture:
Input Layer: 784 neurons (flattened 28x28 image).
Hidden Layers: Two fully connected layers (128 and 64 neurons).
Output Layer: 10 neurons (representing digits 0â€“9).
Results
Loss Plot: The model's loss decreased steadily over 5 epochs, indicating successful learning.

Test Predictions: Sample predictions from the test set:
